How to install (Manually):
	
    1: Extract to /minetest/mods (or ./minetest/mods) folder

    2: Rename to ice_armor. (unless it is already) (Note: THIS MUST BE NAMED ICE ARMOR TO FUNCTION!)

    3: Launch Minetest

    4: Configure world and enable modifaction 'ice_armor'
    
    This should work, If not please alert me in Issues(https://github.com/DeletedUser56/ice_armor/issues)! Thanks.
